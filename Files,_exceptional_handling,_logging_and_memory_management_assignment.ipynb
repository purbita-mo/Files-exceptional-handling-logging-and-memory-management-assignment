        "\n",
        "In Python, the __del__ method, also known as a destructor, is a special method that is called automatically right before an object is about to be removed from memory by the garbage collector, essentially performing any necessary cleanup tasks when an object is no longer referenced by the program\n",

        "1. Multithreading:\n",
        "Involves running multiple threads within a single process.\n",
        "Threads share the same memory space (global variables, data) and resources, which can make communication between them easier and more efficient.\n",
        "Best suited for tasks that are I/O-bound (like file handling, network requests) rather than CPU-bound because threads run in the same CPU core and Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel execution for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

        "2. Multiprocessing:\n",
        "Involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space and resources.\n",
        "Processes are independent and can run on different CPU cores, which allows true parallelism, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "Since each process has its own memory space, communication between processes can be more complex (using inter-process communication like queues or pipes), but it avoids the GIL limitation.\n",
